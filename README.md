PyPi Crawler
************

PyPi crawler is a small module provided to download multiple packages from
the pypi.org index. It's main purpose (or how I use it) is to download 
multiple version of a single package which may then be added to package
cache used as input for an internal PyPi server. This is useful if you
work on a cluster without internet access to easily setup internal package
ressources.
