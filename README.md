# PyPi Downloader Utility


PyPi Downloader is a small utility provided to download multiple packages from
the [PyPi Index](https://pypi.org/) index fulfilling the specified requirements
(i.e. a package version and package type). It's main purpose (or how I use it)
is to download multiple version of a single package which may then be added to
a package cache used as input for an internal PyPi server. This is useful if 
you work on a cluster without internet access to easily setup internal package
ressources.

## Getting Started

The following instructions will tell you how to install the downloader and
give a short example on how to use the utility.

### Installing

After cloning the repository to your local disc switch to the top folder
of the project containing the `setup.py` file and execute

```console
  $ pip install .
```

which will install the PyPi Downloader to your currently loaded python
environment. If the installation went okay the provided `sync_package_cache`
command should now be available from the command line:

```console
  $ sync_package_cache --help
  usage: sync_package_cache [-h] configfile

  Reads the provided config file and builds the package cache according to the
  defined settings.

  positional arguments:
    configfile  Path to a valid config file.

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

### Downloading Packages from PyPi

To download packages from PyPi using this utility setup a configuration
file containing a general settings section `[settings]` defining the type
of packages to look for and the location to which the downloaded packages will
be stored (Note that each package will be stored to a subfolder corresponding
to the package name located inside the folder specified by the `cache_folder`
variable). In addition the `[settings]` section also allows to set specific
python versions and platforms using the `python` and `platform` specifiers.
Valid identifiers for these keys are `py2`, `py27`, `cp27`, ... and 
`manylinux1_x86_64`, `linux_x86_64`, ... respectively (see 
[PEP427](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427)) The actual packages you 
are interested in are specified under the `[packages]` section, following the
`[settings]` section, accepting a list of packages (and a version /
version range). An example configuration file is shown below.

```console
  $ cat sample_config
  [settings]
    cache_folder: ./cache
    packagetypes: bdist_wheel,sdist
    python: cp27,py27,py2
    platform: any,manylinux1_x86_64,linux_x86_64

  [packages]
    requests>=2.19.0
    pip>=9.0.0,<10.0.0
    numpy==1.14.3
```

To download the specified packages to the `./cache` folder call the implemented
`sync_package_cache` command with the setup configuration file as argument:

```console
  $ sync_package_cache sample_config
  requests-2.19.1.tar.gz      [####################################################################]  100%
  pip-9.0.3.tar.gz            [####################################################################]  100%
```

After the script has finished successful, all files matching the defined
specifications have been stored to the set `cache_folder`:

```console
  $ ls cache/requests
  requests-2.19.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl  requests-2.19.0.tar.gz
  requests-2.19.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl  requests-2.19.1.tar.gz
  $ ls cache/pip
  pip-9.0.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl  pip-9.0.0.tar.gz  pip-9.0.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl
  pip-9.0.1.tar.gz  pip-9.0.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl  pip-9.0.2.tar.gz  pip-9.0.3-py2.py3-none-any.whl
  pip-9.0.3.tar.gz
```
